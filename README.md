ðŸ‘‹ **Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository!**

I'm **Nejma Nefertiti,** an emerging software engineer with a *passion for coding and social justice.* Currently, I'm taking my next steps into the tech world through Tech Pathways at Columbia University's Justice Through Code (JTC) program.

ðŸŒ± **As a student in JTC**, I'm not only learning the intricacies of programming but also exploring how technology can be a force for *positive change* in marginalized communities.

ðŸ’» **I'm a beginner presently**, but I'm enthusiastic to apply what I'm learning in JTC to real-world coding challenges. From web development to data analysis, to prompt engineering, I'm determined and excited to expand my knowledge, gain insight, and further my career.

ðŸ“š **Outside of coding**, you'll frequently find me participating in conversations that explore how technology intersects with social justice. These discussions are enriched by the knowledge I acquire through my studies at JTC and my life experiences. Additionally, I'm actively pursuing further learning opportunities by studying independently on Coursera and taking advantage of office hours to absorb new concepts whenever possible.

ðŸš€ **I'm highly fascinated** by the prospects and potential on the horizon, along with the opportunity to create *positive change through technology*. I'm eager to engage with and cooperate alongside my fellow programmers in order to achieve our collective goals.
