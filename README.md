        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository!</h1>
        
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Nejma Nefertiti, an emerging software engineer with a passion for coding and social justice. Currently, I'm taking my first steps into the tech world through The Foundation course at Columbia University's Justice Through Code (JTC) program.</p>
        
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>ðŸŒ± Exploring how technology can be a force for positive change in marginalized communities</li>
            <li>ðŸ’» Real-world coding challenges, including web development, data analysis, and prompt engineering</li>
            <li>ðŸ“š Participating in conversations at the intersection of technology and social justice</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>Outside of coding, you'll frequently find me participating in conversations that explore how technology intersects with social justice. These discussions are enriched by the knowledge I acquire through my studies at JTC and my life experiences. Additionally, I'm actively pursuing further learning opportunities by studying independently on Coursera and taking advantage of office hours to absorb new concepts whenever possible.</p>
        
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>ðŸš€ I'm highly fascinated by the prospects and potential on the horizon, along with the opportunity to create positive change through technology. I'm eager to engage with and cooperate alongside my fellow programmers in order to achieve our collective goals.</p>
