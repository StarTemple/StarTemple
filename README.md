        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ <strong>Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository!</strong></h1>
        <p><strong>I'm Nejma Nefertiti,</strong> an emerging software engineer with a passion for coding and social justice. Currently, I'm taking my first steps into the tech world through The Foundation course at Columbia University's Justice Through Code (JTC) program.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ± As a student in JTC, I'm not only learning the intricacies of programming but also exploring how technology can be a force for <em>positive change</em> in marginalized communities.</p>
        <p>ðŸ’» <strong>I'm a beginner</strong> presently, but I'm enthusiastic to apply what I'm learning in JTC to real-world coding challenges. From web development to data analysis, to prompt engineering, I'm determined and excited to expand my knowledge, gain insight, and further my career.</p>
        <p>ðŸ“š <strong>Outside of coding, you'll frequently find me participating in conversations that explore how technology intersects with social justice. These discussions are enriched by the knowledge I acquire through my studies at JTC and my life experiences. Additionally, I'm actively pursuing further learning opportunities by studying independently on Coursera and taking advantage of office hours to <em>absorb new concepts</em> whenever possible.</p>
        <p>ðŸš€ <strong>I'm highly fascinated</strong> by the prospects and potential on the horizon, along with the opportunity to create <em>positive change through technology</em>. I'm eager to engage with and cooperate alongside my fellow programmers in order to achieve our collective goals.</p>
